# Ticket Management (Twig)

A port of the React Ticket Management demo to PHP + Twig. This is a minimal scaffold that reproduces the UI and client-side behavior using Twig templates and framework-less JavaScript.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies with Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

2. Start the built-in PHP server from `public`:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

3. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes

- The tickets data is stored in localStorage in the browser, same as the React demo.
- Tailwind is included via CDN for simplicity.
